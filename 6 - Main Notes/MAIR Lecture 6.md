Keep in mind the design, type of data etc..

Cohen's d is  how large the size actually given the population.

Confounding factor
- Account aga

Problem with Big Data
- Data is often collected without a reason
- Not clear whether data is best measure for the question at hand
-Statistical techniques sometimes incorrectly applied
Net result: findings are presented as theory based, whereas tehy should be presented as exploratory

When we make quick choices, under uncertainty, we rely on:
- info that we use to make our decision
- prior knowledge (like a riged referee in a tennis match)
- amount of time we have to make the decision
