# Action Potential in the Neuron

![[Pasted image 20250910195018.png]]

Dendrites are the part of the neuron that recieves incoming signals. If the simulation is strong enough the signal is transmitted through the axon called action potential or the **neuron fires**

Ions: potassium (K+), chloride and sodium (Na+)

### Neuron at Rest
Concentration of sodium higher outside. Potassium are more inside the cell. At rest there are more positive charged **outside**. **Eloctrochemical gradiant**

### Movement of ions

Ions cannot move freely so there must be some proteins to facilitate the movement. Most ions cross membrane through ion channel.

### Ion channels

Some are always open and some need a signal to tell them to open or close

**Voltage-gated ion channel** open when a membrane potential reach a certail value
Most of them allow one or a small subset of ions to pass through.

As many sodium ions rush in and we have overshoot, then the membrane becomes positive the sodium channel shuts, making the channel inactivated.

After potassium ions go outside of the cell. Eventually the membrane becomes negative again. **Repolarizaion**.

When we have hyperpolarization the potasium channels close

> An action potential never changes, the only think that can change is the frequency of the action potential. Neuron may fire multiple time per second in intense pain.

1. A small stimulus causes a graded potential

2.  A stimulus above threshold creates an action potential and the neuron fires
