# Ml for Human Vision and Language

kernel size = receptive field (almost the same). The size of the convolution is more common to be the receptive field

Shared weights are not happening in biological systems. 

page 12

Responses for edges are happening later in the biological nn. The input is the output of a retina NOT an image.

> Oreintation selectivity.

1. Contract is initially computed in an orientation-independent filter
	1. In the retinal gnglion cell
	2. Artificain DCNNs often avoid this step, going directly from inage to edge oirentation.

Hypercolumn: we can find it and has representation of all information about one location of the image. 2x2 millimimers all of this informaiton

V1 feature maps
- Colour (red, green, blue yellow, light, dark)
- Eye (left, righ)
- Spatial frequency (continuous)
- Orientation (continuous)
- Motion direciton (continuous)

page 23

after v3
Magnocellular and parvocellular (retinal cell type) becomes What vs Where (info)or form and color vs motion and space (features) or recognition vs action planning (goals) or ventral vs dorsal (gross anatomy)  or temporal vs parietal (lobes)

Eccentricity = How far away are you from where are you looking

page 37
Humans are really bad at consepsualising what is happening in the brain.

page 38
V1 only cares about ORIENTATION
for the brain the images are the same

for v2 
![[Pasted image 20250917163228.png]]
we need to find correlations too (relationships between them)

Beyond V2 we still don't have a good idea of what is happening
