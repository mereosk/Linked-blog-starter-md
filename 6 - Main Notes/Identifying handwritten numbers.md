# Identifying handwritten numbers

### Where is it used?
- Mobile Banking
- Automated teller machines
- Digit
for tasks like check depositing. So what is **check depositing**. A "paper check" is a financial instrument for authorizing a bank to transfer funds from the payer's account to payee's account. So an AI identifier's main targets would be:
1. date
2. payee
3. amounts (both forms)
4. signature
5. routing/account numbers (but most of the type they are not handwritten)

## Question 1

> Discuss with your group, write, then describe to your teacher, a list of at least 3   applications where **automatic recognition of hand-written numbers** would be useful.

1. I would be really useful if used in **hand-written checks**, which contain *date*, the *name of payee* , *amounts(both forms)*, *signature* that are all hard-written.
2. It would **digitize history.** Find *trends* in economic data that are always hard-written. Furthermore, it would make historic data more accessible for scientists, such as dates, census books, or tax rolls from the past.
3. Last but not least, it is very important in **postal services**, since their scanners need to process millions of ZIP codes and street numbers and sort them *instantly* and *correctly*.
